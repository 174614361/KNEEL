# KNEEL: Hourglass Networks for Knee Anatomical Landmark Localization

The readme is **WIP**
## About
The repository includes the codes for training and testing, 
annotations for the OAI dataset and also the pre-trained models.

## How to install and run
### Preparing the training data
We provide the script and the annotations for creating the cropped ROIs from the original DICOM images. See the file `bf_landmarks`
### Reproducing the experiments from the paper
All the experiments done in the paper were made with PyTorch 1.0.0 and anaconda.
To run the experiments, simply copy the content of the folder `hc_experiments` into `hc_experiments_todo`.
Then, run the script
